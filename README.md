Voting System

As we all know a big democratic country need elections to choose government 
on a periodic basis. And on the scale of country physical elections or a chit 
system is impossible. Hence, we need a digital solution which can be used 
multiple times. I’ve made a C program so solve this issue, where it can be 
operated only by admin and anyone with the voter ID can vote. But the system 
doesn’t allow the person without the correct id to vote. It also prevents people 
from voting multiple times. Only the admin can start/close the software using 
his/her key. Once the program started the admin can enter the names of 
candidates for whom to vote and give them a code that the users will enter in 
order to cast their vote. Once names entered admin can start the process for 
voting then people can come enter their id and get verified, after verification 
they can enter the code for the person for whom they want to vote and confirm 
to submit. Once submitted the system will automatically go back to the page for 
next voter to vote. Once the voting is done admin can enter the exit input along 
with his key to exit the program. After exiting the results will be shown.
